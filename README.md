# Psychometric

This gem attempts to create a simple uniform structure for results of
psychometric assessments from various providers. It also implements methods to
request those results from the providers' APIs.

Persisting the results is left to the consumer.

It has been extracted from the [Leaply](https://leap.ly) recruitment platform.

### Currently Supported Providers

* [Top Talent Solutions](https://www.tts-talent.com/)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'psychometric'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install psychometric

## Usage

* Require the gem and the provider(s) you need.
* Provide your authentication and assessment requirements.
* Request the results.

```ruby
# All providers are not required by default
require "psychometric"
require "psychometric/providers/top_talent_solutions"

# Create an instance of the Provider
provider = Psychometric::Providers::TopTalentSolutions.new username: 'psycho@metric.com', password: 'insecure'
# Authenticate the instance (most will need this step)
provider.authenticate!
# Indicate which Assessment (params needed specific to provider)
assessment = Psychometric::Providers::TopTalentSolutions.assessment project_id: 1234, model_id: 5678
# Fetch the results
results = provider.results assessment

results #=> [#<Psychometric::Result subject: "#<Psychometric::Subject name: "John Doe" identity: "8801235111088">" values: {"Numbers"=>"5", "Letters"=>"7", "Shapes"=>"3"}>]
```

## Development
